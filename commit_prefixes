    substantial speed improvements or refactoring work.

BUG Bug Fix

DOC Documentation change

TST tests

API API change
    User-facing API change (rm function/method/module/class, change call
    signature or important defaults). In general things that may break user
    code.

BEH Behavioral change
    Changes that are not API changes (e.g. add a warning, add a side effect
    like writing a file, change less important defaults such as compiler
    optimization flags). Things that won't break code in the sense that a
    function has a new name or doesn't exist, but may have changed (better)
    defaults, for instance.

REL Release-related
    World-facing release-related changes (setup.py, versions, pip, packaging,
    dependencies).

BLD Build system
    Internal build-related (setup.py, compilers, extensions).

MNT Maintenance
    This is the new preferred replacement for INT ("internal change"). Any
    internal change such as refactoring, style, cleanup.

INT Internal change
    Deprecated, use MNT.

STY Style change
    Deprecated, use MNT. pep8-ish style fixes.
